I'm gon' drop a fucking fo' in this fucking twenty (Hell yeah)
For my brothers that I lost, I done lost too many (Hell yeah)
Uh, real killers get involved, I roll with too many (Grrah, grrah, grrah, hell yeah)
Fuck a thirty, I got the fifty (Uh)
I heard you roll with plenty, I got enough bullets for an army
They just took my slime today, I dare niggas try to stop me (What the fuck?)
I won't show no mercy, stand over his body when I pop 'em (Baow, baow, baow)
Brodie say he'll do it for me, you don't got to, bro I got 'em
It's gon' get bloody and gory, this shit turn into a problem
